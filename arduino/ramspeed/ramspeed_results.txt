ESP32 240mhz, spiram @ 80mhz

 in MBit/s  8bit   16bit    32bit
RAM           22      45       89
PSRAM         12      17       21


But with 32bit CPU at 240 MHz this should be 240x32 == 7680 MBit.

Octal PSRAM https://www.issi.com/ww/pdf/Octal-Memory.pdf

400 MBit/s


SPI PSRAM 

For the reset of the above configurations:

Flash and PSRAM share the same internal clock.

Quad Flash only supports STR mode. Octal Flash may support either/both STR/DTR modes under OPI mode, depending on the flash model and the vendor.

Quad PSRAM only supports STR mode, while Octal PSRAM only supports DTR mode.


Modes
STR mode - Single Transfer rate
DTR mode - Double Transfer rate
QPI mode - quad SPI having 4 data lines instead of one
QSPI, known as queued-SPI 

SPI   - Serial Peripheral Interface
PSRAM - pseudostatic (random-access) memory
