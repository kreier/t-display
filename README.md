# TTGO T-Display ESP32 board

This board is chosen as the default board for students to learn programming because it has a display for output, a USB-C connector for data transfer and charging, build-in WiFi and Bluetooth and it is inexpensive. These are major advantages to Arduino Uno, ESP8266 or other ESP32 boards.

We are going to program these both in MicroPython and Arduino C
